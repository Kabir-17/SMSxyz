  - **One-Time Fees**: One-off charges (admission, books, uniform, etc.)
- Set due date (day of month for monthly payments)
- Configure late fee percentage
- System automatically calculates yearly total: `(Monthly × 12) + One-Time Fees`

## ✅ Recent Fixes (v1.0.0 - October 2025)

### 🎯 Critical Bug Fixes Completed

#### 1. One-Time Fees Calculation ✅
**Issue**: After payment collection, due amounts weren't including one-time fees.
**Root Cause**: Pre-save hook only calculated `totalPaidAmount` from monthly payments.
**Fix**: Modified hook to sum both monthly and one-time fees:
```typescript
totalPaidAmount = monthlyPaid + oneTimePaid
```
**Impact**: Now correctly reflects all payments in paid/due calculations.

#### 2. dueDate Validation Error ✅
**Issue**: "Path `dueDate` is required" when creating fee records with one-time fees.
**Root Cause**: One-time fees schema had `required: true` for dueDate.
**Fix**: Changed to `required: false` (one-time fees don't have specific due dates).
**Impact**: Fee records create successfully without validation errors.

#### 3. Financial Dashboard Crash ✅
**Issue**: "Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'bySeverity')" error.
**Root Cause**: Missing null checks for nested defaulters data.
**Fix**: Added comprehensive null safety with optional chaining.
**Impact**: Dashboard loads gracefully even without complete data.

#### 4. Auto-Creation of Fee Records ✅
**Issue**: Students showing null fee status in accountant dashboard.
**Root Cause**: Fee records not created automatically for new students.
**Fix**: Auto-create records when loading student list (if fee structure exists).
**Impact**: All students show proper fee status or helpful message.

#### 5. Console Log Cleanup ✅
**Issue**: Excessive debug logging in production.
**Fix**: Removed all console.logs from frontend and backend.
**Impact**: Clean console output, kept only critical error logging.

### 📊 Testing Status
- ✅ All authentication flows working
- ✅ Fee structure management tested
- ✅ Payment collection verified (monthly + one-time)
- ✅ Auto-sync feature working
- ✅ All dashboards loading without errors
- ✅ Database operations validated

**See [TESTING_REPORT.md](./TESTING_REPORT.md) for comprehensive test results.**

**Status**: 🚀 **PRODUCTION READY**
